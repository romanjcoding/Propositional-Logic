# Propositional-Logic
A connective is functionally complete if it can be composed to express all possible truth tables. The prototypical examples of a 2-ary (two paramater) connective which are functionally complete are NAND and NOR. In the N-ary case, necessary and sufficient conditions for functional completeness are given by Post's theorem.
