# Propositional-Logic
A connective is functionally complete if it can be composed to express all possible 2D truth tables. The prototypical examples of 2-ary (two paramater) connectives which are functionally complete are NAND and NOR. In the N-ary case, necessary and sufficient conditions for functional completeness are given by Post's theorem.

Let $B = \{0,1\}, f: B^n \to B$.
